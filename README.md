## Useful Resources

#### [Github](https://github.com)
A github account will allow you to build and collaborate on software using github as well as authenticate w/ freecodecamp.org. You can create a github account by navigating to their [join page](https://github.com/join). You will need to provide an email address that you can log in to immediately and click a verification link. If you are under 13 years of age, you will need a parent or guardian to help you create the account and accept the Terms of Service.

#### [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
Colab is an interactive, collaborative python computing environment specially designed for scientific computing and research. It is software from Google that directly integrates with other Google Apps like Google Sheets and Google Drive. The code notebooks themselves can be stored in version control or in Google Drive. Google Drive offers revision history of the documents you store which allows some scientists and researchers to succeed with software projects without using more sophisticated version control.

You can launch this repository in Colab directly from the badge below.

#### [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
FreeCodeCamp offers a large selection of interactive learning experiences for various programming and computer science topics. You can use your github account to sign in and preserve your progress across sessions. In this camp, we'll be most interested in [scientific computing with python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/) and [data analysis with python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/).

#### [WeCodeKC](http://www.wecodekc.org/)
The WeCodeKC website contains information, calendars, and links about WeCodeKC events, courses, instructors, and resources.
