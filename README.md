## Useful Resources

#### [Github](https://github.com)
A github account will allow you to build and collaborate on software using github as well as authenticate w/ freecodecamp.org. You can create a github account by navigating to their [join page](https://github.com/join). You will need to provide an email address that you can log in to immediately and click a verification link. If you are under 13 years of age, you will need a parent or guardian to help you create the account and accept the Terms of Service.

#### [Binder](https://mybinder.org/)
Binder allows you to launch notebook servers directly from a github repository link. We will use it to host our labs.

#### [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
FreeCodeCamp offers a large selection of interactive learning experiences for various programming and computer science topics. You can use your github account to sign in and preserve your progress across sessions. In this camp, we'll be most interested in [scientific computing with python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/) and [data analysis with python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/).

#### [WeCodeKC](http://www.wecodekc.org/)
The WeCodeKC website contains information, calendars, and links about WeCodeKC events, courses, instructors, and resources.
