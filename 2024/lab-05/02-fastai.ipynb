    "\n",
    "- **y_range**: This parameter sets the range of the output values (Temperature in this case). We specify `[0,600]` because we expect our calculated temperatures to fall within this range based on the input data. Setting this range helps the model focus its learning on a specific interval of values, improving accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **layers**: This parameter defines the structure of the neural network in terms of hidden layers and the number of neurons in each layer. Here, `[200,100]` means the first hidden layer has 200 neurons, and the second has 100 neurons. More neurons and layers can model more complex relationships but may require more data and training time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **metrics**: These are functions used to evaluate the model's performance. We use `rmse` (root mean squared error), which measures the average magnitude of the errors between predicted values and actual values. Lower values of RMSE indicate better performance, as it means the predictions are closer to the actual values."
