    "but might overshoot the optimal solution.\n",

    "- **Batch Size**: The number of samples processed before the model is updated. Smaller batch sizes can make training\n",
    "more stable, while larger batch sizes can speed up training.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Number of Epochs**: The number of times the entire training dataset is passed through the model. More epochs can\n",
    "lead to better performance but can also cause overfitting if too many are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Smart Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Learning Rate Scheduling**: Adjusting the learning rate during training. For example, starting with a higher\n",
    "learning rate and gradually decreasing it can help the model converge faster and more accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Early Stopping**: Monitoring the model's performance on a validation set and stopping training when performance\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Regularization Techniques**: Methods like dropout (randomly turning off neurons during training) and weight decay\n",
