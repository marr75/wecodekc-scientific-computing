# WeCode KC - Scientific Computing & AI Lab 7: Large Language Model Review

## Overview

In this lab, we will explore the world of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and how AI is advancing fields such as 
communication with animals, software development, and ethical decision-making. We will use Python-based AI tools to 
experiment with word embeddings and dimensionality reduction techniques to visualize multilingual word data.

### Topics Covered
- **AI and Communication with Animals**
- **Significance of AI across various domains**
- **How Large Language Models (LLMs) Work**
- **Key Techniques used in LLMs**
- **Ethical Considerations**

## Lab Outline

### 1. Warm-Up: How AI Is Helping Us Talk to Animals
We'll begin with a short discussion on AI's role in animal communication, prompted by a video. Consider these questions:
- Do you recognize any concepts and techniques from the video?
- What tools and technologies do we already have to work on this problem?
- What are we missing to take this further?

### 2. Significance of AI
AI is impacting many areas of our lives. We will break this down into four main categories:
- **Scientific**: How AI is enabling breakthroughs in various fields.
- **Economic**: AI’s role in software development and automation.
- **Artistic & Cultural**: AI’s influence on creative fields like writing and art.
- **Ethical**: What responsibilities do we have as we advance AI?

### 3. How Do Large Language Models Work?
A review of neural networks and transformers will help us understand how LLMs:
- **Store and retrieve information**: How do LLMs like GPT store "facts"?
- **Understanding vs. processing**: Do humans really understand how LLMs work?
- We'll discuss both sides of the argument and ask you to form your own opinion.

### 4. Techniques in LLMs
In this section, we will look at the cutting-edge methods that improve LLM performance:
- **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)**: Combining retrieval systems with generation models.
- **PAL (Program Aided Logic)**: Integrating external logic or code into language models.
- **CoT (Chain of Thought)**: Enhancing reasoning in multi-step problems.
- **Agentic AI**: Using tools and multiple passes to break down complex tasks.

### 5. Ethical Considerations
The ethics of generative AI are critical. We'll explore questions such as:
- What types of harm can AI cause, and who is most vulnerable?
- What can we do to minimize harm and ensure fairness?
- What decisions should humans be in charge of, even with advanced AI?

## Learning Goals

By the end of this lab, students should be able to:
1. Understand the significance of AI across multiple domains.
2. Grasp the basic working mechanisms of Large Language Models.
3. Familiarize themselves with techniques such as RAG, PAL, CoT, and agentic AI.
4. Engage in discussions on the ethical implications of generative AI.

## Lab Activity

Students will be guided through a coding exercise where they will:
1. Encode a set of English and Spanish words using pre-trained word embedding models.
2. Visualize these embeddings using UMAP dimensionality reduction.
3. Create Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) plots for both languages, showing word distributions in 2D space.

## Ethical Reflection

In addition to technical skills, the lab encourages students to reflect on how their knowledge of AI and LLMs could be 
applied responsibly in real-world scenarios.
