    "# Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "Notebooks are files that store source code, documentation, and output together. The Jupyter server also associates \"kernels\" with notebooks that actually run the code and produce the output. These features combined mean that notebooks are a great way to work on problems with long run times, complex steps, multi-disciplinary teams, and remote/asynchronous work among multiple team members.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sub-unit of a notebook is a \"cell\". Cells have a type (i.e. code, markdown, raw text), contents, and an output (though the output might be empty). They execute and hold on to their output independently from one another but code in the cell will most likely alter the \"global\" context available to other cells (for example, defining variables, populating data, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of our notebooks are written in python but there are other kernels available (R, Node, etc.) and there are extensions that when loaded allow for mixed languages in the same notebook, powerful visual rendering, and interactive experiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a little bit more on the mechanics of a notebook, [see this post](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tutorial/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Your mouse and keyboard will work about the way you would imagine they would and `Shift + Enter` will execute the currently highlighted cell before moving the highlight to the next cell. This includes \"markdown cells\" and \"code cells\" both, though the \"markdown cells\" aren't going to do anything interesting when executed. It's also useful to know that you hotkeys respond to your current focus in a notebook. Many hotkeys are cell specific, some apply to the whole notebook, and most only work when outside of a cell (\"Command Mode\") rather than editing the text or source inside a cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other useful key combinations (capitalization irrelevant and only used for readability):\n",
    "- While outside of a specific cell:\n",
    "  - `A` will create a new cell above the current cell and move your focus outside of that new cell\n",
    "  - `B` will create a new cell below the current cell and move your focus outside of that new cell\n",
    "  - `D, D` will delete the current cell and move your focus outside of the next cell\n",
    "  - `M` will convert the cell type to markdown without changing its contents\n",
    "  - `R` will convert the cell type to raw without changing its contents\n",
    "  - `Y` will convert the cell type back to code (the default) without changing its contents\n",
    "  - `Enter` will enter the cell to edit its content\n",
    "- While outside any cell:\n",
    "  - `Z` will undo a cell operation\n",
    "  - `Shift + Z` will redo an undone cell operation\n",
    "  - `Shift + M` will merge the content of multiple selected cells\n",
    "  - `Shift + L` will toggle line numbers\n",
    "  - `00` will restart the notebook's kernel (after a brief confirmation, `Enter` will accept the confirmation dialogue)\n",
    "- While inside any cell:\n",
    "  - `Ctrl + M` will activate \"Command Mode\" (exiting the cell but leaving it highlighted/selected)"

Speaking of which, restart the interpreter from command mode by double pressing the numeric zero key, `0, 0`. This will put whatever kernel/interpreter you're using in a clean state. This is generally helpful when you've made changes and you want to verify the script works in a clean state or if you've made a mistake affecting the interpreter state that you wish to undo.\n",
