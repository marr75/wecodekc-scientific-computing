## Section 1 Lab 2: Python Basics

In this lab, we'll use jupyter to explore the basic syntax, data types, and control structures of python.
We'll start with a very high level overview followed by more in-depth sections. Each section is broken into
a pair of overview and exercise notebooks. Complete all of the exercises and save them to your Google Drive
to complete the lab.
