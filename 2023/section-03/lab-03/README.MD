## Section 2 Lab 3: Introduction to Generative AI

In this lab, we will be using a pre-trained model from Facebook research to generate music. These models use a powerful neural network architecture called "Transformers" to understand the structure of complex things like text, speech, music, and images. Once those structures are understood, the model can generate new things with it's underlying understanding of the structure of the items it was trained on.

We'll learn more about neural networks and Transformers in future labs. Today will exploratory.

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:
- Understand the basics of neural networks
- Download and use pre-trained models
- Use a pre-trained model to generate music
- Display music in a notebook for playback
