    "# Tsiolkovsky Rocket Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Tsiolkovsky rocket equation**, also known as the *ideal rocket equation*, is a fundamental principle in rocketry. It links the **change in velocity** (delta-V) of a rocket to several key parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Effective exhaust velocity** (ve)\n",
    "- **Initial mass** of the rocket (m0)\n",
    "- **Final mass** of the rocket (mf)\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "The equation is presented as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Δv = ve * ln(m0 / mf)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a breakdown of what each symbol represents:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Δv`: The change in velocity\n",
    "- `ve`: The effective exhaust velocity (also known as specific impulse)\n",
    "- `m0`: The initial mass of the rocket (including propellant)\n",
    "- `mf`: The final mass of the rocket (after the propellant is burned)\n",
    "- `ln`: The natural logarithm function\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python Function for the Rocket Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "We can create a Python function to help us experiment with these parameters. This function would take three parameters and solve for the fourth, allowing for interactive learning and experimentation."

    "### Pronunciation Guide: Tsiolkovsky\n",
    "\n",
    "**Konstantin Tsiolkovsky** was a Russian and Soviet rocket scientist and pioneer of astronautics. His surname, Tsiolkovsky, can be challenging for English speakers. Here is a simplified guide to pronouncing \"Tsiolkovsky\":\n",
    "\n",
    "**\"tsee-OL-kov-skee\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break that down:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\"tsee\"**: Sounds like \"see\" but with a \"t\" at the start.\n",
    "- **\"OL\"**: Sounds like the \"ol\" in \"bowl\".\n",
    "- **\"kov\"**: Sounds like \"cove\".\n",
    "- **\"skee\"**: Sounds like \"ski\".\n",
    "\n",
    "When saying it all together: **\"tsee-OL-kov-skee\"**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an approximation and might not capture all the subtleties of the Russian pronunciation, but it's close enough for most English speakers."

    "## The Pythagorean Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Bit of History\n",
    "The Pythagorean theorem is named after the ancient Greek mathematician Pythagoras (around 570 – 495 BC), who is traditionally credited with its discovery. This theorem is fundamental to many fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics and was one of the earliest known geometric theorems. It has been used for thousands of years to calculate distances.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that even though it's named after Pythagoras, the concept was well-known to mathematicians before him, especially in ancient Egypt and Babylon.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's the Theorem?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. This can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "`a² + b² = c²`\n",
    "\n",
    "In this equation, `c` represents the length of the hypotenuse, and `a` and `b` represent the lengths of the other two sides.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Right triangle with sides a, b, and c](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/Pythagorean.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that if you know the lengths of two sides of a right-angled triangle, you can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the third side. It's a powerful tool in geometry!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Symbols and Their Meanings\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of the Pythagorean theorem, the symbols `a`, `b`, and `c` are used to represent the lengths of the sides of a right-angled triangle. The `a` and `b` are the lengths of the two legs (the sides that form the right angle), and `c` is the length of the hypotenuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, we use these same symbols as variables. A variable is like a box in the computer's memory where we can store a single value. So in a Python program, we could have:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = 3\n",
    "b = 4\n",
    "c = (a**2 + b**2)**0.5  # This calculates the length of the hypotenuse using the Pythagorean theorem\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this code, `a`, `b`, and `c` are variables that store the lengths of the sides of a triangle. The `**` operator is used to raise a number to a power, and `**0.5` calculates the square root of a number."
