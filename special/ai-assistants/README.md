# README - WeCodeKC Scientific Computing Lab

## Overview
Welcome to the WeCodeKC Scientific Computing Lab! In this session, we're going to dive into some exciting topics and get hands-on experience with coding and AI. Our main focus areas for this lab will be:

1. **Understanding AI's Limitations**: Refreshing our knowledge on what AI, particularly in the realm of math and symbolic manipulation, is not yet proficient at.
2. **Program-Aided Logic and Agent Tools**: Exploring how programs can assist in logical reasoning and understanding the concept of agents equipped with tools.
3. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Delving into the principles of OOP, a crucial paradigm in software development that helps us manage and organize complex code.
4. **OpenAI Assistants API**: Learning about the OpenAI Assistants API (currently in beta), and how it represents objects and their relationships.
5. **Collaborative Coding Experience**: Engaging in a "Code with Me" session using an IDE, where we'll write and run code together to interact with the OpenAI Assistants API.

## Lab File: `lab.py`
The `lab.py` file contains Python code that we will be using and discussing during our lab session. Here's a quick overview of what's inside:

- **Classes and Inheritance**: The file includes Python classes like `AutoNamer`, `FunctionTool`, and `AssistantManager`. These classes demonstrate the use of inheritance, a key feature of object-oriented programming.

- **Properties and Decorators**: You'll see the use of Python properties and decorators, which are powerful features for managing access to class attributes and modifying class methods.

- **AI Integration**: The file integrates with the OpenAI Assistants API, showing practical examples of how to create and manage AI assistants.

- **Type Annotations**: Throughout the file, you'll notice type annotations that make the code more readable and easier to understand, especially in terms of what kind of data each function expects and returns.

- **Error Handling and Validation**: The file also demonstrates robust error handling and data validation techniques, crucial for writing reliable and maintainable code.

- **Interactive Tools**: We have included interactive tools like `Calculator`, which is a subclass of `FunctionTool`, to show how we can create functional components within our classes.

## Join the "Code with Me" Session
During our lab, we will have a live coding session where we will collaboratively write and run code. This is a great opportunity to ask questions, share ideas, and learn from each other in real-time.

Looking forward to an exciting and educational session with all of you!
