# Scientific Computing w/ Python

## Summary
Through a series of short lectures, demos, and longer interactive labs, students will explore math & science topics with accompanying python techniques, libraries, and visualizations.
Given the relatively short session length and young audience, we will prefer to learn by doing or interacting with topics rather than long theory or lectures.
This will at times require that the students have already surveyed adjacent topics (i.e. have coded previously in a textual/programmatic environment or have a passing familiarity with statistics) or can accept a quick explanation and demonstration that leaves them with more to explore in terms of theory of the topic.

## Software & Platforms
We will be running python in interactive notebook environments hosted originally on GitHub but actually executing in Google CoLab. CoLab will also allow students to save their changes to the labs and their projects and connect to rich media supported by the Google Apps suite of functionality. Students will need Google Apps and GitHub log-ins that they (and potentially WeCode) know the username and password for and can access inside and outside of class. Additionally, if they are using an organizational Google Apps log-in (many schools administer Google Apps for their students) it MUST support CoLab. Some school districts administering Google Apps block all but the bare minimum apps so CoLab is disabled.

### Platforms:
- Google Apps Suite
- Google CoLab
- GitHub

### Software & Major Libraries:
- Git (version control)
- Python (code interpreter)
- Jupyter/iPython (interactive and supportive computing framework)
- Numpy/Pandas (vectorized mathematical libraries for series/arrays and tables/matrices)
- Tensorflow/Torch (best in class neural network libraries)
