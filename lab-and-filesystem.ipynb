    "A: URL - while the url bar is not - strictly speaking - a part of JupyterLab, it's noteworthy that JupyterLab is a web app and uses common web app concepts for greater accessibility/adoption and easier engineering/architectural decisions. URLs can be used to share links to specific notebooks/assets, save and retrieve workspaces (as exampled here), and change between different Jupyter interfaces (Lab vs the classic interface).\n",
    "\n",
    "B: Tabs (and Launcher) - JupyterLab provides a tabbed interface to notebooks and other assets it is serving. There are hotkeys for quickly navigating forward through tabs (`Ctrl + Shift + ]`), backward through tabs (`Ctrl + Shift + [`), and activating a previously used tab regardless of its order in the list (`Command + Shift + '`). It can be confusing to use a tabbed browser interface AND a tabbed JupyterLab interface. This confusion will improve with time but it can be helpful to operate a single JupyterLab tab in a browser window alone and use other windows for standard tabbed browsing. This points to another important element of JupyterLab work (and complex scripting/app development work in general), multiple monitor setups. More screen real estate allows you to see more at once and form a richer mental model of your workflow. You'll have less work to do to access the information you need and you'll have less context switching to do. I **strongly recommend** performing most of your workflows in a location you have an attached monitor, a separate keyboard, and a separate mouse. Your producitivity will be substantially compromised without. The launcher interface will appear whenever there are no tabs available or when you click the plus (+) sign in the Toolbar to the left. The launcher offers grouped options detailed below. Note that the launcher shows you what path any new notebook or other asset would be created at.\n",

    "C: New Notebooks Group - create a new, blank, untitled notebook with code cells that execute using the Kernel you select (here we have Python 3, Julia, NodeJS, and R)\n",
    "\n",
    "D: New Consoles Group - Similar to the New Notebooks Group with 3 key differences: nothing will be persisted once the console is terminated, there's no notebook functionality (i.e. Markdown cells, notebook hotkeys, editing old cells, etc.) because this is a purely IPython hosted (even for the other kernels) REPL without the notebook system running, and the execution prompt is at the bottom of the page and pushes older executed inputs and outputs toward the top. This functionality is good for testing snippets and small pieces of code, quickly executing bits of utility code, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "E: Other - anything besides a notebook or console (including a shell terminal). \"Text File\" is a catch all for any blank file that JupyterLab doesn't have a richer relationship with. JSON, CSV, SQL, etc. will receive some special rendering and/or editing treatment but JupyterLab considers them all text formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "F: File Browser and Directory Listing - access to files and directories with some JupyterLab conveniences wrapped around them such as a green circle to indicate a notebook has an active kernel. You can open, rename, move, delete, download, get paths/links to a file/directory, copy, paste, and duplicate from this interface but none of these facilities is as powerful as the operating system or scripting interface and many of these functions won't be a part of efficient multi-file or large file workflows. This is some of the weakest functionality in JupyterLab compared to needs/expectations of the end user.\n",
    "\n",
    "G: Toolbar - icons to open a new launcher at the current directory, create a new folder in the current directory, upload to the current directory (which also supports drag and drop so I've never really used), and refresh the current directory (because the File Browser doesn't have a realtime view of the filesystem). Simple stuff. Your standard dropdown menus are just above the toolbar, we've gone over some of the most important functions as hotkeys and icon functionality but please familiarize yourself with the general content of these dropdowns, too. You'll use them more as you advance in using JupyterLab and take on more complex projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "H: Sidebar - tabs represented by icons for the file browser (folder), the process browser (stop or go symbol), the command palette (artist's palette), the notebook cell tools (wrench), and the tab manager (box in a box?)."
